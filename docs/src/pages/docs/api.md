## Memoize your Props!

The React Charts `<Chart>` component has a few options that need to be **stable** or **memoized using either `React.useMemo` or `React.useCallback`**. Using an unstable option incorrectly shouldn't severly break any basic functionality, but could results in infinite change-detection loops in your app or at the very least, your charts will be severly non-performant. If an option says it needs to be stable, it's not kidding around!

## Data Model

React Charts uses a data shape based on **arrays of series and nested arrays of datums in those series**.

```js
const data = [
  {
    label: 'Purchases',
    data: [
      {
        date: new Date(),
        stars: 299320,
      },
      // ...etc
    ],
  },
]
```

Visualization data can come in practically any shape and size, so **memoization of data into this shape is almost always necessary**.

```tsx
const data = React.useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      label: 'Series 1',
      data: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
    {
      label: 'Series 2',
      data: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
    {
      label: 'Series 3',
      data: [
        // ...
      ],
    },
  ],
  []
)
```

The individual datums in a series' `data` array can be anything you want! Just remember that most of the types for React Charts will require you to pass the type of your `Datum`s as the first generic type to work correctly.

## Axes

React Charts uses axes to configure a fair amount of the chart. Axes handle many things like:

- Accessing chart values from your series' `Datum`s
- Optionally positioning your axis on the grid
- Optionsally configuring the scale type for your axis
- Optionsally configuring the element type for series that are tied to your axis

To date, we have the following scale types available:

- `linear` - A continuous axis used for plotting numerical data on an evenly distributed scale. Works well both as a **primary and secondary** axis.
- `band` - A banded axis commonly used to plot categories or ordinal information. Works well as the **primary** axis for bar charts with ordinal domains.
- `time` - A continuous axis used for plotting UTC `Date`s on an evenly distributed scale. Works well as a **primary** axis.
- `timeLocal` - Similar to the `time` scale, but uses localized `Date` objects instead of UTC. Works well as a **primary** axis.
- `log` - A continuous axis used for plotting numerical data on a logarithmically distributed scale. Works well as a **secondary** axis

Axes are a required component of a React Chart. Both a `primaryAxis` and at least one axis vis `secondaryAxes` must be configured.

```javascript
import { Chart } from 'react-charts'

type MyDatum = { date: Date, stars: number }

function MyChart() {
  const data = [
    {
      label: 'React Charts',
      data: [
        {
          date: new Date(),
          stars: 23467238,
        },
      ],
    },
  ]

  const primaryAxis = React.useMemo(
    (): AxisOptions<MyDatum> => ({
      getValue: datum => datum.date,
    }),
    []
  )

  const secondaryAxes = React.useMemo(
    (): AxisOptions<MyDatum>[] => [
      {
        getValue: datum => datum.stars,
      },
    ],
    []
  )

  return (
    <Chart
      options={{
        data,
        primaryAxis,
        secondaryAxes,
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Secondary Axis Element Types

Secondary axes for the most part are automatic, but can be optionally configured to render their respective series using 3 different element types using the `AxisOptions<TDatum>['scaleType']` property:

- `line`
  - 1 Line per series (optional, eg. for Bubble/Scatter charts)
  - 1 Circle per datum (optional)
- `area`
  - 1 Enclosed area per series
  - 1 Line per series (optional)
  - 1 Circle per datum (optional)
- `bar`
  - 1 Rectangle per datum

Example

```javascript
const secondaryAxes = React.useMemo(
  (): AxisOptions<MyDatum>[] => [
    {
      getValue: datum => datum.stars,
      elementType: 'bar',
    },
  ],
  []
)
```

### Curve Types

All element types that support lines or curves can be configured by passing any `curve` generator function as the `AxisOptions<TDatum>['curve']` option. By default, horizontal and vertical series default to using `monotoneX` and `monotoneY` curves, respectively. More information can be found at [`d3-shape curves`](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curves)
